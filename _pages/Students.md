# The Trustworthy Knowledge-driven Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (TKAI)  is seeking highly-motivated Ph.D. student to conduct multidisciplinary research on the problems such as:

* Encoding knowledge graph with Artificial neural network to construct safe, robust Artificial general intelligence system (AGI) that can be deployed to work on high-risk domains such as medicine, finance. This field is also known as **neuro-symbolic AI**, where goal is to build trustworthy AI system by encoding interpretable knowledge
* Design mathematical foundation and derive **theoretical limits** for these models to work in polynomial time
* Design predictive coding inspired architectures for sequential modeling, encode multi-modality signals into the systems and evaluate them on critical or high-risk domains
* Design computational models that can encode various fairness metrics while learning, such that model has a prior and produces fair information by design
* Design computational models that are capable of generating and recognizing languages when trained on low-resource datasets (low resource NLP)
* Most importantly we are working on encoding knowledge and build neural architectures that are explainable (XAI) by design and also by visualization.

* **Position Requirements**: Master’s/Bachelor’s degree in majors/fields including but not limited to: Mathematics, Applied Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science/Engineering, linguistic and other related fields.

* **Preferred Experience**: experimental research experience such as, but not limited to Fluency in at least one programming language C/C++ or python, Good working knowledge about Artificial intelligence and Reinforcement learning, Linguistics, formal language theory etc.

# Instructions for Undergraduate Students
* Please refer to instructions highlighted above
* Interest in working on relevant topics highlighted in our lab’s webpage
* Self-motivated and eager to explore challenging problems in NLP and AI.
* Ideally some background in AI/NLP and working knowledge of linear algebra and stats

# How to work with me?
* Ideally you will start as **volunteer** with possibility of funding based on performance. Please remember evaluation is based on research conducted in any given semester and not on line of codes you wrote.
* When you volunteer, I would expect you to work for minimal 5-10 hours, however given your obligations are minimal, one can adjust involvement based on schedule and current learning curve. 
* Second approach is to take course credits or independent study and formally work on some challenging problems.

# Instructions for Graduate Students seeking me as an advisor
* Graduate students should satisfy requirements highlighted in the main and under UG Students sections.
* Graduate students are required to add additional hours and work on thesis and/or research article with me.

# Things not to do
* Asking me about funding without even working with me or taking my courses.
* Not looking at my papers and website, and sending me an email your work is great in AI/NLP/CV and I wish to solve everything. Such emails won’t be answered. This clearly shows you did not invest any time in reading my work/papers.
* If you wish to work with me, then your email should have following points
 1.What: What are the problems you wish to explore and how it aligns with our lab’s agenda/interest.
 2. How: How your knowledge/experience would be beneficial for the group. 

## Most important thing to remember is I can guide you, but I won’t be doing entire job for you. 
## If you satisfy all criteria and wish to work on challenging topics
* Please send me an email(**remember to mention topic**) with your CV and other relevant details.       




<!--If you are an undergraduate student interested in working with us, you must meet the following requirements:

Able to work at least 5-10 hours a week

Self-motivation and an interest in researching reasoning

Willingness to do the kind of work few others in the world are doing

An ability to tackle new and difficult problems in creative ways

Ideally: Some background (either through coursework or your own independent studies) in one of the topics we research.

Strong preference for students who have already taken: data structures and algorithms, an AI class, and a machine learning or NLP course (if you haven't yet been able to take one at USF, a good idea is to work through the Stanford NLP course online).

Students who have been working with me a few semesters and have proven themselves capable of research may be eligible for paid research positions, and the chance to be involved in research publications. I also offer for-credit options, through independent study or supervised research. If you are interested, please take a good look at our areas of research, and contact Dr. Licato with a CV or résumé that clearly shows your relevant experience, interests, and coursework.

How to participate. If you're a good fit, then there are at least two ways you can participate:

Volunteer. You can join the lab as a volunteer, in which case your obligations are minimal. But I'm also very selective about who I take on as a volunteer. If it appears that you're going to be a student who just sits silently in lab meetings and doesn't do much else, then I'm sorry, but you're not a good fit.

Course Credit. You can sign up for an independent study or supervised research credit; these are 3 credit courses offered through the CSE department (note that there are course prerequisites for these).

Things to NOT do: I often see students making the following mistakes in contacting me. Try to avoid these:

Contact me without reading this site thoroughly. I'm looking for people who can be independent researchers, and if you can't show that you're capable enough to find this website and read it (or worse, you ask me what the URL is), I won't have confidence you'll be a good researcher.

Expect me to do your work for you. I want to see that you have taken the time to read my papers, really understand what my lab is trying to do, and figure out how you can contribute. I do not have the luxury of taking on students whose hands I have to hold with every little task. I'll guide you, but I won't drag you along.

Use general platitudes. If you find yourself writing an email that says "I see you do a lot of research in AI, and I think it's interesting" and not much more, it's a huge red flag that you didn't actually take the time to understand what my lab is working on. That doesn't bode well for my confidence in your abilities. -->
