The “TrustWorthy Knowledge Driven Artificial Intelligence Laboratory” has four active research projects.

**Formal method meet AI/Neuro-Symbloic AI**: My work is at the intersection of language, memory, and computation—spanning Natural Language Processing (NLP), linguistics, and formal language theory. In particular, I design knowledge-guided interpretable deep learning systems focused on generating trustworthy information. Furthermore, I am also interested in investigating the mysterious success of deep learning in recognizing natural language from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

 **Predictive coding-inspired Neural Architectures**: Our lab, in collaboration with [NAC](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/nac_lab.html), works on designing learning algorithms and computational architectures guided by theories of the brain and its functionality that emphasize solving challenges such as continual/lifelong learning, learning with minimal supervision, Reinforcement Learning, and sparsity (both in computer vision and natural language processing).

 **Low Resource and Robust NLP**: In collaboration with our collaborator from [University of Mississippi](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/), we are working on designing low-resource Natural language processing (NLP) agents that are robust and capable of generating safe/ethical information. Such models are aimed to help under-represented groups.
 
 **Physics Informed Neural Networks**: In colloboration with [Department of Earth and Engineering Sciences](https://sites.psu.edu/ultrasonics/pshokouhi/) at Pennsylvania State University we are working on designing on Neural Networks that obey physics law and require minimum resource/data to find stable solution for given domain.
