I am Sudarshan Nayak. After completing my bachelor's from NIT Rourkela in ECE  and masters in ECE from IISc Bangalore, I joined Western Digital India where I worked for 3 years. More interest to pursue Machine Learning has motivated me to join Penn State University as a Master's student in CSE, where I am working under the guidance of [Prof. Dan Kifer](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~duk17/), [Prof. Parisa Shokouhi](https://sites.psu.edu/ultrasonics/pshokouhi/), and Dr. Ankur Mali on the DOE project of Co2 storage site response prediction using Deep learning. My field of interest is Machine Learning in primary, while I have experience in Firmware and Electromagnetics domain. Feel free to reach out to me at szn5400@psu.edu
