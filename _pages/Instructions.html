<h1 id="prospective-undergraduate-students-">Prospective Undergraduate Students:</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are an undergraduate student interested in working with us, you must meet the following requirements:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Able to work at least 5-10 hours a week</p>
</li>
<li><p>Self-motivation and an interest in researching reasoning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Willingness to do the kind of work few others in the world are doing</p>
</li>
<li><p>An ability to tackle new and difficult problems in creative ways</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ideally: Some background (either through coursework or your own independent studies) in one of the topics we research.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Strong preference for students who have already taken: data structures and algorithms, an AI class, and a machine learning or NLP course (if you haven&#39;t yet been able to take one at USF, a good idea is to work through the Stanford NLP course online).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Students who have been working with me a few semesters and have proven themselves capable of research may be eligible for paid research positions, and the chance to be involved in research publications. I also offer for-credit options, through independent study or supervised research. If you are interested, please take a good look at our areas of research, and contact Dr. Ankur Mali with a CV or résumé that clearly shows your relevant experience, interests, and coursework.</p>
</li>
<li><p>How to participate. If you&#39;re a good fit, then there are at least two ways you can participate:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Volunteer. You can join the lab as a volunteer, in which case your obligations are minimal. But I&#39;m also very selective about who I take on as a volunteer. If it appears that you&#39;re going to be a student who just sits silently in lab meetings and doesn&#39;t do much else, then I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;re not a good fit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Course Credit. You can sign up for an independent study or supervised research credit; these are 3 credit courses offered through the CSE department (note that there are course prerequisites for these).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Things to NOT do: I often see students making the following mistakes in contacting me. Try to avoid these:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Contact me without reading this site thoroughly. I&#39;m looking for people who can be independent researchers, and if you can&#39;t show that you&#39;re capable enough to find this website and read it (or worse, you ask me what the URL is), I won&#39;t have confidence you&#39;ll be a good researcher.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Expect me to do your work for you. I want to see that you have taken the time to read my papers, really understand what my lab is trying to do, and figure out how you can contribute. I do not have the luxury of taking on students whose hands I have to hold with every little task. I&#39;ll guide you, but I won&#39;t drag you along.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use general platitudes. If you find yourself writing an email that says &quot;I see you do a lot of research in AI, and I think it&#39;s interesting&quot; and not much more, it&#39;s a huge red flag that you didn&#39;t actually take the time to understand what my lab is working on. That doesn&#39;t bode well for my confidence in your abilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
